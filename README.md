API for SHOPPER.app

The API contains the necessary endpoints for the proper operation of the entire project. It supports the database and performs operations on multimedia files located on the server. Using functions, the user can perform all database-related operations. Thanks to extensive server-side validation, users will not be able to enter information in the database that does not meet the requirements. Validation also applies to files located on the server, an appropriate user directory is created for each file, and the file itself is validated in detail. In the project, I paid particular attention to the completeness of data and, in case of errors, returning an appropriate response with an appropriate status code. The program can be run on Windows and Linux.


## Description of the modules
The program contains four modules, the Database_connection.py module is responsible for creating a connection to the database, retrieves the necessary data placed in the environment variable and uses them to connect to the MySQL server. The Media_validator.py module contains a function validating the uploaded graphic file. The function takes the allowed extensions from the environment variable and checks whether the entered file meets the requirements. The Query_creator.py module contains two functions, one dynamically creates a database query, depending on what the user wants to search for, the other retrieves messages for a given conversation and converts DATETIME objects to a string. The API.py module is the most important module of this program, it is here that all operations related to the database and server are performed. It has the function of uploading, downloading and deleting multimedia files from the server. It is also possible to download photo paths and change the main ads photos. All database operations are wrapped in a try except clause, so in the event of an error, everything will be handled correctly and returned. The functions are also thoroughly validated in case of entering external data that should not be in the database. The transmitted parameters and request body of the request are also validated. Resource ids are converted at the endpoint level, which provides additional validation if someone would like to connect to the endpoint by entering a value other than integer as the resource or subresource id.
