API for SHOPPER.app

The API contains the necessary endpoints for the proper operation of the entire project. It supports the database and performs operations on multimedia files located on the server. Using functions, the user can perform all database-related operations.
The program can be run on Windows and Linux. Thanks to extensive server-side validation, users will not be able to enter information in the database that does not meet the requirements.
